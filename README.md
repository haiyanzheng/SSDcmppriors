This repository contains R functions to implement Bayesian sample size determination for experiments comparing two groups, for which relevant pre-experimental information from multiple sources can be incoporated in a robust prior to support both the design and analysis. Readers of the following paper can use the R functions to reproduce the numerical results and/or figures reported.

**H Zheng, T Jaki, JMS Wason. (2021) Bayesian sample size determination using commensurate priors to leverage pre-experimental data. Submitted.**

Several R packages need to be installed, namely, "ggplot2", "gtools" and "reshape2".

For any issues or technical questions relating to the implementation, please contact Dr Haiyan Zheng at haiyan.zheng@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk
